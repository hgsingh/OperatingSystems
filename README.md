## Synopsis

These are all the projects from CS 333 which is an operating systems class. The first 3 projects are specifically for multithreading, resource management purposes. These projects implement a operating system kernel in a kernel specific programming language (KPL) which was developed by Dr. Porter (PDX). The kernel development took place over 5 projects, the last two implement more resource management, file I/O and system calls.
